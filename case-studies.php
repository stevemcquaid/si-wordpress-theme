      <p>To help the UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay express its gratitude to the donors who have contributed nearly $600 million for the construction of UCSF Medical Center's new $1.5 billion children’s, women’s, and cancer hospital complex, we created a unique and highly immersive interactive installation.
      </p>
      <p>The centerpiece of the installation is a 4’ by 13’ interactive wall, utilizing display hardware manu- factured by Prysm, Inc. of San Jose, California. The wall features a gesture-controlled “attract mode” that captures the attention of visitors walking past the installation. Then, with their curiosi- ty piqued, visitors can use the wall’s touch-screen capabilities to learn more about donors, and also explore engaging, interactive content about the institution’s hospitals, faculty, staff, and pro- grams. The wall’s sophisticated hardware and software allow it to accommodate multiple simul- taneous users along its 13-foot length.</p>
