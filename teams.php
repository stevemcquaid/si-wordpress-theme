      <p>Building owners around the world are using large-format outdoor display installations to add signifi- cant value to their properties. These installations can monetize nearby pedestrian and vehicular traffic, create a higher profile for the building, and provide highly valuable promotion for tenants. In addition to becoming commonplace in landmark environments like New York’s Times Square, large-format out- door installations are also generating advertising and sponsorship revenue and boosting rental rates at well-located properties in smaller cities worldwide.</p> 
      <h3>Services Covering the Full Project Lifecycle</h3>
      <p>We then work with clients to develop and document the installation’s design and technical specifica- tions. This includes evaluating and selecting the best systems, providers, and developers for project hardware and software, and creating detailed plans for the installation’s integration with the project’s architecture.</p>

      <p>To help the UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay express its gratitude to the donors who have contributed nearly $600 million for the construction of UCSF Medical Center's new $1.5 billion children’s, women’s, and cancer hospital complex, we created a unique and highly immersive interactive installation.
      </p>
      <p>The centerpiece of the installation is a 4’ by 13’ interactive wall, utilizing display hardware manu- factured by Prysm, Inc. of San Jose, California. The wall features a gesture-controlled “attract mode” that captures the attention of visitors walking past the installation. Then, with their curiosi- ty piqued, visitors can use the wall’s touch-screen capabilities to learn more about donors, and also explore engaging, interactive content about the institution’s hospitals, faculty, staff, and pro- grams. The wall’s sophisticated hardware and software allow it to accommodate multiple simul- taneous users along its 13-foot length.</p>
